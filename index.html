    <h1>Communities by Visa Relations</h1>
  </header>
  <div id="intro">
    <p>
      In this visualization, I explore the visa data of 232 countries. Looking at the visa requirements between countries, we find couple of interesting insights. These insights are illustrated below as steps of presentation. Visa-free in this context is used as a country not requiring visa for the citizens of selected country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map and other elements are interactive. So feel free to explore the visualization yourself - or check out my observations by going through the steps.
    </p>

  <div id ="explanation">
    <div id="annotation-steps">
      <div class="annotation-step" id="annotation-step1" style="display:block;">
        <h4> No visa required </h4>
        <p> Initially, in the below map countries are colored based on the amount of visa-free countries. Darker green means higher amount of countries that the citizens can freely travel to (without a visa). We already see couple of patterns emerging. For instance the countries with major economies (EU, USA, Canada) have the most visa-free countries. While interestingly China has below average number of visa-free countries. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="annotation-step" id="annotation-step2">
        <h4> Citizens of EU and New Zealand enjoy visa-free travel the most </h4>
        <p> European Union countries and New Zealand are in the top 5% of countries that have the highest visa-free countries. The citizens of these countries are able to travel to more than 138 countries without any visa necessary. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="annotation-step" id="annotation-step3">
        <h4> EU has common visa-free countries </h4>
        <p> We see more or less the same group of visa-free countries for the EU. Probably this is related to EU wide regulations with those visa-free countries - and the economic relationships of EU. In the map visa-free countries are colored in blue while the countries requiring visas are shown as grey - for the selected country in orange. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="annotation-step" id="annotation-step4">
        <h4> Afghanistan has the lowest visa-free countries </h4>
        <p> In contrast, Afghanistan citizens can travel to only 14 countries without a visa. And almost none of them are visible in our map view. We could hardly see that Haiti and Kosovo don't require visa from Afghan citizens. Interesting to see that Haiti and Kosovo also are among the countries with having the lowest visa-free countries. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="annotation-step" id="annotation-step5">
        <h4> Communities in Visa Network </h4>
        <p> When countries are grouped based on the visa-free relations among themselves, communites emerge. Those communities are mostly based on proximity of countries - this makes sense as it's easier to travel to a neighbor country for business or pleasure. Below map communities are colored based on the community each belongs to. Grey colored ones don't have a community.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="annotation-step" id="annotation-step6">
        <h4> Multiple Communities in Middle East </h4>
        <p> Conflicts in diplomatic relationships of Middle East are clearly visible here. In this region we see 4 distinct communities - along with several countries that don't belong to any community. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="annotation-step" id="annotation-step7">
        <h4> Pink Community around the globe </h4>
        <p> One interesting community is the Pink colored one. This consists of Bolivia, Chile, Turkey, Thailand, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia - and couple of more countries. This community goes beyond geographical distances - connecting citizens across the globe. </p>
